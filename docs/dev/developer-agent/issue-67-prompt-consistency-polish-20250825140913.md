# Issue 67: Prompt Consistency Polish (developer-agent)

## Context
Polish wording across development prompts for clarity and consistency (capitalization of PR, explicit @-mention mechanics as new PR comments, Producer title template + example, dependency guidance).

## Targets
- prompts/development/developer-agent.prompt.md
- prompts/development/conflict-resolver-agent.prompt.md
- prompts/development/producer-agent.prompt.md
- prompts/development/validator-agent.prompt.md

## Plan
1. Update developer-agent prompt (PR capitalization; mention mechanics)
2. Update conflict-resolver prompt (re-review instruction; new comment)
3. Update producer-agent prompt (title template + example; dependency guidance)
4. Update validator-agent prompt (cross-doc mention guidance: new comments; @ prefix)

## Notes
- Keep scope limited to requested polish.
- Do not alter workflows or unrelated content.
