Hi maintainers

## Developer Agent Prompt Alignment with A5C Workflow

### Description
Align the developer-agent prompt and metadata with the A5C operational workflow and recent reviver-agent conventions. Updates include:
- Add @developer-agent alias to mentions in agents/development/developer-agent.agent.md
- Expand prompts/development/developer-agent.prompt.md with A5C process: Analysis, Action, Validation, Communication, Mention cleanup, and best practices
- Create this progress log under docs/dev/developer-agent/

### Plan
- Update agent mentions to include @developer-agent for consistency with other prompts
- Enhance prompt with concise, actionable workflow steps to ensure consistent behavior across repos
- Open a branch and PR; request @validator-agent review when ready

### Progress
- Updated agent mentions and prompt
- Prepared to create branch and PR via gh

### Results
- Pending PR creation and review

### Time and Cost
Took N/A locally; CI to compute.
