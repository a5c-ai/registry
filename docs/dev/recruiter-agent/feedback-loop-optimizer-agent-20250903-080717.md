# Feedback Loop Optimizer Agent â€” Work Log (initial)

## Summary
Scaffold a new development agent `feedback-loop-optimizer-agent` that periodically audits repositories for automated feedback loops (pre-commit hooks, e2e tests, CI workflows, lint rules, coverage, monitoring/alerts/on-call triggers) and opens actionable issues. Inherits from `producer-agent`. Uses the same schedule as `product-optimizer-agent`.

## Plan
- Review producer and product-optimizer agents to mirror conventions
- Add agent file with `from: producer-agent`, events incl. schedule, mentions, priority
- Add prompt with detailed checklist, preferred open-source tools, and issue templates
- Update root `config.yml` remote_agents list
- Open draft PR and iterate

## Notes
- Prefers OSS/free options: pre-commit, Playwright/Cypress, ESLint/Prettier/Ruff/Black, pytest-cov/nyc/lcov, OpenTelemetry + Prometheus/Grafana/Loki + Alertmanager/Grafana OnCall, Healthchecks.io
