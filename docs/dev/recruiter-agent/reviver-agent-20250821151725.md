# Reviver Agent - Work Log

Author: recruiter-agent
Start: $(date -u)

## Goal
Create a new reviver-agent that periodically scans open issues and PRs to revive stuck threads by tagging the next-responsible agent. If a PR has merge conflicts, it calls @fix-conflicts instead. Include alias @reviver.

## Plan
- Add agents/development/reviver-agent.agent.md
- Add prompts/development/reviver-agent.prompt.md
- Register agent in root config.yml remote_agents
- Open draft PR and iterate

## Notes
This work was requested in issue #59.
\n## Results (initial)\n- Added agents/development/reviver-agent.agent.md\n- Added prompts/development/reviver-agent.prompt.md\n- Registered agent in config.yml (remote_agents)\n\nNext: Mark PR ready and request validation.\n
