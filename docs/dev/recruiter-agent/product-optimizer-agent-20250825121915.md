# Recruiter Log: Product Optimizer Agent

## Context
- Issue: https://github.com/a5c-ai/registry/issues/68
- Goal: Add a new development agent that analyzes product flow/usability vs specs and opens issues.

## Plan
- Review existing agent structure and prompts in this registry
- Scaffold `product-optimizer-agent` inheriting from `producer-agent`
- Add a dedicated prompt covering flow/usability/specs-missing behavior
- Register the agent in `config.yml`
- Open a draft PR linking to Issue #68

## Progress
- Initialized branch and documentation
