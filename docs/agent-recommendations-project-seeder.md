# Agent Recruitment Results for Project Seeder Agent

## Overview
Analysis of the A5C agent registry to identify agents that complement the Project Seeder Agent functionality described in issue #7.

## Project Seeder Agent Requirements
1. Look for existing similar seeds, templates or starters in GitHub
2. Populate repository with ideal project structure
3. Copy seeds and do initial modifications
4. Search for relevant agents and add them to config.yaml
5. Open issues for remaining work and enhancements

## 🌟 Primary Integrations (Essential)

### 1. Recruiter Agent - **PERFECT MATCH** 🎯
- **File**: `agents/development/recruiter-agent.agent.md`
- **Why**: Already has the exact functionality needed for step 4 of the Project Seeder's requirements
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Searches for relevant agents and adds them to config.yaml configurations
  - Creates new A5C agents with proper configuration
  - Generates agent templates and boilerplate code
  - Ensures agents follow A5C conventions and standards
- **Triggers**: `@recruiter`, `@agent-builder`, `@recruit-these-agents`
- **Priority**: 77

### 2. Developer Agent - **Core Integration** 💻
- **File**: `agents/development/developer-agent.agent.md`
- **Why**: Essential for code generation, project structure implementation, and technical guidance
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Code generation and refactoring
  - Feature implementation
  - Architectural decisions
  - Technical implementation guidance
- **Triggers**: `@developer`, `@dev-help`, `@implement`
- **Priority**: 70

### 3. Code Review Agent - **Quality Assurance** 🔍
- **File**: `agents/development/code-review-agent.agent.md`
- **Why**: Critical for ensuring generated project templates meet quality and security standards
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Security analysis
  - Code quality assessment
  - Architecture review
  - Testing coverage analysis
- **Triggers**: `@code-review`, `@quality-check`
- **Priority**: 80

## 🔧 Secondary Integrations (Highly Useful)

### 4. Security Scanner Agent (External Reference)
- **Status**: Referenced in code-review-agent but not yet in registry
- **Why**: Essential for validating security aspects of generated project templates

### 5. Test Generator Agent (External Reference)
- **Status**: Referenced in code-review-agent but not yet in registry
- **Why**: Critical for generating test files and configurations for new projects

### 6. Deployment Agent (External Reference)
- **Status**: Referenced in code-review-agent but not yet in registry
- **Why**: Important for setting up CI/CD pipelines and deployment configurations

## 🎨 Tertiary Integrations (Situational)

### 7. Image Generation Agent - **Asset Creation** 🖼️
- **File**: `agents/media/image-generation-agent.agent.md`
- **Why**: Useful for creating project logos, documentation images, and visual assets
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Text-to-image generation
  - Multiple AI model integration
  - Custom dimensions and aspect ratios
- **Triggers**: `@image-generation`, `@create-image`
- **Priority**: 67

### 8. News Aggregator Agent - **Trend Analysis** 📰
- **File**: `agents/news/news-aggregator-agent.agent.md`
- **Why**: Helps identify trending technologies and frameworks for project seeding
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Automated news aggregation
  - Topic-based content analysis
  - Scheduled execution
- **Triggers**: `@daily-news-aggregator`
- **Schedule**: Daily at 12:00 AM

## 📋 Recommended Agent Workflow for Project Seeder

1. **Project Seeder Agent** creates initial project structure
2. **Recruiter Agent** (`@recruit-these-agents`) finds and adds relevant agents to config.yaml
3. **Developer Agent** (`@developer`) handles code generation and implementation
4. **Code Review Agent** (`@code-review`) validates quality and security
5. **Image Generation Agent** (`@image-generation`) creates visual assets if needed

## 🚀 Missing Agents to Consider Adding

Based on the Project Seeder requirements, consider creating these additional agents:
- **Template Finder Agent** - Searches GitHub for existing templates/starters
- **Repository Structure Agent** - Handles folder structure and file organization
- **Issue Creator Agent** - Automatically creates issues for remaining work
- **Tech Stack Analyzer Agent** - Analyzes project requirements and suggests optimal stacks

## 🔄 Implementation Strategy

The Project Seeder Agent should be configured to automatically mention these agents in sequence:
1. `@recruit-these-agents` for agent discovery and configuration
2. `@developer` for code implementation
3. `@code-review` for quality validation
4. `@image-generation` for visual assets (if needed)

This creates a complete workflow from project scaffolding to production-ready setup!
