# Video Editing Agent

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Agent created and added to registry

**Purpose**: Performs advanced video editing and post-production using AI-powered tools like video inpainting, object tracking, effects application, and automated editing through MCP GenMedia video processing services

**Implementation**: Available at `/agents/media/video-editing-agent.agent.md`

## Key Features

- **Temporal video inpainting** for seamless object removal and content filling across video frames
- **Object tracking and removal** with intelligent motion-aware editing capabilities
- **Automated scene detection** and intelligent highlight generation for efficient editing
- **Color grading and correction** with professional-grade color management tools
- **Video stabilization and enhancement** using AI-powered motion analysis
- **Professional editing workflows** supporting complex multi-track projects
- **Quality assurance and validation** ensuring technical compliance and consistency
- **Cross-agent integration** with Video Generation, Music Generation, and Speech Generation agents

## How it works

- Analyzes video editing requests and source materials
- Selects appropriate AI video editing tools based on requirements (Veo editing, FFmpeg AI, DaVinci Resolve automation, etc.)
- Processes input videos with specified editing operations
- Applies advanced techniques like video inpainting, object removal, motion tracking, and temporal effects
- Performs automated editing tasks like scene detection, highlight generation, and rhythm matching
- Enhances video quality through upscaling, stabilization, color grading, and noise reduction
- Creates transitions, effects, and composite sequences when requested
- Validates edited content for quality, continuity, and technical compliance
- Maintains edit decision lists (EDL) and version control for complex projects
- Organizes outputs with comprehensive timelines, metadata, and rendering specifications

## Cross-Agent Workflow Integration

This agent is designed to work seamlessly with other media generation agents:

1. **Video Generation** → **Video Editing Agent** (post-production and enhancement)
2. **Music Generation** → **Video Editing Agent** (soundtrack integration and synchronization)
3. **Speech Generation** → **Video Editing Agent** (dubbing and voiceover integration)
4. **Video Editing** → **Audio Processing Agent** (final audio mastering)
5. **All Editing** → **Asset Optimization** (delivery and platform optimization)
