- Invite the bot to target Discord servers with appropriate permissions
- Configure the discordmcp server with the bot token and server details
- Test the connection and verify command responsiveness

### 2. Command Structure
- **Standard Commands**: `!help`, `!agents`, `!status`, etc.
- **Agent Invocation**: `@agent-name your request here`
- **Direct Mention**: `@discord-bot route to @agent-name: request`
- **Thread Creation**: `!thread topic` to create dedicated conversation threads
- **Admin Commands**: `!config`, `!permissions`, etc. for administrative functions

### 3. Workflow Integration

## Usage Examples

### Basic Communication
```
User: @discord-bot What's the status of the project?
Bot: [Forwards to project-manager-agent and returns response]
```

### Agent Routing
```
User: @discord-bot ask @developer-agent to create a new component
Bot: [Routes request to developer-agent and returns the response]
```

### Thread Management
```
User: @discord-bot create a thread for the new feature discussion
Bot: [Creates a new Discord thread and confirms creation]
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow
```
User: @discord-bot plan and implement a new login page
Bot: [Coordinates with project-seeder-agent, developer-agent, and validator-agent]
```

### Server Management
```
User: @discord-bot create a new channel for the backend team
Bot: [Creates the channel with appropriate permissions and confirms]
```

This agent is essential for bridging Discord communication with the A5C agent ecosystem, enabling teams to interact with AI agents through familiar Discord interfaces.
