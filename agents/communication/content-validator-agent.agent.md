# Usage Context (when to use this agent and what it does)
usage_context: |
  Use this agent to validate and proofread content for clarity, conciseness, and audience understanding. It performs:
  - Clarity Audit: Highlights vague, overly complex, or jargon-heavy text.
  - Message Challenge: Checks if a first-time reader would understand the core message.
  - Ambiguity Hunt: Identifies phrases that could be misinterpreted.
  - Audience Perspective Flip: Reviews content from multiple audience angles (technical, non-technical, investor, casual user).
  - Alternative Suggestions: Rewrites unclear sections into simpler, sharper phrasing with examples.
  - Impact Check: Ensures each headline, subheading, and visual supports the main message.
  - Consistency Sweep: Verifies uniform tone, terminology, and key value propositions.
  - Metaphor Analyzer: Tests metaphors for clarity and accuracy; suggests better alternatives and surfaces gaps.

# Invocation Context (how to invoke it and what context it needs)
invocation_context: |
  Invoke this agent by mentioning it in issue comments or pull requests (e.g., "@content-validator-agent please audit this content").
