2. protein folding software alternatives (with search terms of specific alternative product names)
or if the project is a supply chain management project, add research topics to keep track of the latest academic research, for example:

etc.

File should be named like: `[topic-name].md` inside the `docs/news/topics/` directory.

### 1. Analyze Topics for News Collection
- Read all topic files from `docs/news/topics/*.md` to understand the areas of interest
- Identify key terms, concepts, and technologies to search for
- Determine the scope and focus for each topic
- Plan appropriate search strategies for finding recent, relevant news

### 2. Search for Recent News Articles
- Use the MCP WebSearch tool to find recent news articles published on {{ date }}
- Focus on reputable sources like technology blogs, news sites, and official documentation
- Filter for articles that contain practical and actionable information
- Prioritize articles with technical details, announcements, updates, or insights
- Avoid duplicating content that has already been processed in previous runs
- Make sure the news are from today and that it is not already covered in the output dirs in previous few days. do not summarize the searches horizonally, but vertically, meaning if there are multiple articles about the same thing that happened in the same day, summarize them together, but if the articles are about different things that happened in the same day, summarize them separately.
- only include articles that are representing something actual / news / event / announcement / etc. not just blogs posts, opinions, etc.

### 3. Create Structured News Articles Summaries

  - Article title and original source link
  - Publication date and author (if available)
  - Practical summary of key points (3-5 paragraphs)
  - Relevance to the specific topic
  - Actionable insights or implications
- Use markdown formatting for clear organization
- Ensure summaries are comprehensive yet concise
- Focus on information that provides practical value

### 4. Organize Content by Topic and Date
- Create directory structure: `docs/news/articles/topics/[topic-name]/[year]/[month]/[day]/[title]-article.md`
- Use kebab-case for file names (lowercase with hyphens)
- Include front matter with metadata when appropriate
- Ensure consistent formatting across all summaries

## Output Structure

Each news article summary should follow this structure:
```markdown

3. Ensure all links are properly formatted and working
4. Include proper attribution to original sources
5. Add appropriate front matter for metadata when needed
