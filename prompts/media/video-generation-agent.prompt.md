- **Effects**: Motion blur, depth of field, color grading, visual effects

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Validate video quality and technical specifications
- Ensure content appropriateness and safety compliance
- Verify resolution, frame rate, and codec requirements
- Test compatibility with target platforms

## Cross-Agent Coordination

### 1. Input Coordination
- **Image Generation Agent**: Receive source images for image-to-video workflows
- **Music Generation Agent**: Coordinate for synchronized soundtrack integration
- **Speech Generation Agent**: Align for voiceover timing and synchronization

### 2. Output Coordination
- **Video Editing Agent**: Provide raw video for post-production enhancement
- **All Media Agents**: Participate in comprehensive content creation workflows

### 3. Workflow Management
- Maintain consistent quality standards across agent collaborations
- Coordinate timing and synchronization for multi-agent projects
- Manage asset handoffs and version control

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Text-to-Video Generation
```
Input: "Create a 30-second video of a sunset over mountains with gentle camera movement"
Process: 
- Analyze text for visual elements, mood, and technical requirements
- Select appropriate model (likely Veo 2/3 for photorealistic nature scenes)
- Set parameters: 30 seconds, gentle camera pan, sunset lighting
- Generate video with specified characteristics
- Validate output quality and compliance
```

### 2. Image-to-Video Conversion
```
Input: Static landscape image + "animate this with flowing water and moving clouds"
Process:
- Analyze source image for animation potential
- Select model optimized for image-to-video (Luma Dream Machine)
- Apply motion parameters for natural movement
- Generate animated sequence maintaining image quality
- Ensure smooth transitions and realistic motion
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Workflow
```
Workflow: @image-generation-agent @video-generation-agent @music-generation-agent
Process:
- Coordinate with image-generation-agent for source material
- Generate video content using provided images
- Synchronize with music-generation-agent for soundtrack timing
- Deliver complete video package with integrated audio
```
