## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Basic Music Generation
```
Input: "Create a 2-minute upbeat electronic track"
Process:
- Analyze prompt for genre (electronic), mood (upbeat), and duration (2 minutes)
- Select appropriate model (Mubert for electronic or Lyria for high quality)
- Set parameters: upbeat tempo (120-130 BPM), electronic style (synth-based)
- Generate composition with specified characteristics
- Validate output quality and musical structure
- Deliver in MP3 format optimized for streaming
```

### 2. Genre-Specific Composition
```
Input: "Generate a classical piano piece in romantic style"
Process:
- Identify classical and romantic style requirements (expressive, emotional)
- Select AIVA for classical composition with romantic characteristics
- Apply romantic-era compositional techniques (rubato, expressive dynamics)
- Generate piano-focused arrangement with proper voicing
- Ensure classical musical structure (sonata form) and harmony (rich chromaticism)
- Deliver in high-quality WAV format (24-bit/48kHz)
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Workflow
```
Workflow: @music-generation-agent @video-generation-agent
Process:
- Analyze video content requirements and emotional tone
- Generate soundtrack based on video narrative and visual style
- Coordinate timing with key video moments and transitions
- Adjust music dynamics to match visual intensity
- Provide stems for flexible mixing with dialogue/effects
- Support synchronized audio-visual production with properly formatted files
- Ensure audio is optimized for video platform specifications
```

### 4. Complex Arrangement Creation
```
Input: "Create an orchestral cinematic piece for a fantasy game trailer"
Process:
- Analyze fantasy game context and cinematic requirements
- Select appropriate model (AIVA or Lyria for orchestral composition)
- Structure with dramatic build, climax, and resolution
- Incorporate fantasy elements (epic percussion, choir, ethereal textures)
- Generate full orchestral arrangement with proper section balance
- Apply professional mastering for trailer impact
- Deliver in multiple formats with stems for flexibility
```

### 5. Mood-Based Composition
